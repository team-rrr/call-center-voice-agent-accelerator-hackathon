# Feature Specification: Voice-Enabled Multi-Agent Orchestration Accelerator

**Feature Branch**: `001-what-a-voice`
**Created**: 2025-09-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "A voice-enabled, multi-agent orchestration accelerator built with Azure AI, FastAPI, and Semantic Kernel. It lets users interact naturally via speech while intelligent agents handle tasks in the background. Why: To simplify the development of real-time, voice-first applications that require modular, intelligent behavior‚Äîmaking it easier for developers to prototype and deploy multi-agent systems without starting from scratch."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
2. **Don't guess** missing details (scalability limits, retention, auth, etc.)
3. **Think like a tester**: every requirement must be verifiable
4. Common underspecified areas flagged below

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A product developer wants to quickly prototype a real-time voice interaction experience where an end user speaks naturally, the system transcribes speech, routes intent to one or more specialized intelligent agents (planner, domain expert, executor), and returns synthesized spoken and textual responses while background tasks continue until completion.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user starts a new voice session, **When** they speak an initial request (e.g., "Check order status and notify shipping"), **Then** the system should capture audio, produce a transcript, delegate sub-tasks to appropriate agents, and provide an audible confirmation.
2. **Given** an agent is executing a long-running background task, **When** the user asks for progress, **Then** the system reports current task status (queued, running, completed, failed) in both textual and spoken form.
3. **Given** simultaneous user speech overlap (user interrupts agent response), **When** interruption occurs, **Then** the system should stop playback and prioritize new user intent processing.
4. **Given** a restricted tool capability request (e.g., data export) outside user permissions, **When** the user attempts it, **Then** the system declines with a clear explanation and does not invoke the restricted action.

### Edge Cases
1. Network dropout mid-session: up to 3 reconnect retries over 15s; failure ‚Üí terminate with reason "connection_lost".
2. Extended silence: prompt at 30s; auto-terminate at 2m inactivity.
3. Rapid-fire commands: FIFO intent queue max depth 5; overflow yields polite overload notice.
4. Conflicting agent outputs: higher confidence wins; delta <0.1 ‚Üí ask user to clarify.
5. Background task failure while user idle: surfaced at next utterance or session summary.
6. Audio degradation: if avg transcription confidence <0.70 over last 3 utterances ‚Üí offer text-only mode.
7. (Removed) Consent revocation handling omitted for simplified scope.

### Functional Requirements
**FR-001** System MUST allow a user to initiate a new real-time voice interaction session.
**FR-002** System MUST transcribe user speech with configurable minimum confidence threshold (default 0.75) below which clarification is requested.
**FR-003** System MUST detect user intent and route tasks to specialized agents.
**FR-004** System MUST support concurrent background task execution while continuing dialogue.
**FR-005** System MUST provide audible and textual responses.
**FR-006** System MUST maintain session context (recent intents, agent outputs) for the session duration.
**FR-007** System MUST allow the user to request status of any running background task by natural language query.
**FR-008** System MUST enable a planner role to decompose complex user requests into sub-tasks.
**FR-009** System MUST enforce access control with two roles (standard, elevated); elevated grants data export & admin tasks; unauthorized attempts rejected with explanation.
**FR-010** System MUST log each user utterance and agent decision.
**FR-011** System MUST allow interruption (barge-in) of system speech by new user speech.
**FR-012** System MUST request clarification when transcription confidence falls below threshold.
**FR-013** System MUST provide a mechanism to end a session and summarize completed tasks.
**FR-014** System MUST prevent invocation of disallowed tools in presence of prompt injection attempts.
**FR-015** System MUST record and expose background task states (queued, running, succeeded, failed, canceled).
**FR-016** System MUST allow configuration of inactivity timeout; default 2 minutes.
**FR-017** System MUST support a fallback interaction mode when real-time audio unavailable.
**FR-018** System MUST present a transparency notice indicating AI-generated content at session start.
**FR-021** System MUST mitigate conflicting agent outputs via confidence ranking; delta <0.1 triggers clarification request.
**FR-022** System MUST surface errors in comprehensible natural language without exposing internal sensitive details.
**FR-023** System MUST allow configuration of maximum session duration; default 30 minutes.
**FR-019** System MUST allow safe cancellation of running background tasks by user command when permissible.
**FR-020** System MUST prioritize user input when overlapping with system audio.

## Assumptions & Decisions
1. Silence prompt at 30s and termination at 2m balance engagement vs. resource use.
2. P95 latency target 1500 ms preserves conversational feel.
3. Confidence threshold 0.75 minimizes misinterpretation risk while avoiding excessive clarifications.
4. Two-role model (standard/elevated) prevents premature complexity.
5. Queue depth limit 5 keeps backlog relevant; overflow signals user to pace requests.
6. Arbitration delta 0.1 avoids trivial clarification loops.
7. Session hard cap 30 minutes prevents indefinite resource consumption.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Session**: Represents a single continuous interaction period; attributes: id, start time, end time, status, user id (or anonymous), language, metrics summary.
- **Utterance**: A discrete segment of user speech; attributes: id, session id, raw transcript text, confidence score, timestamp.
- **Agent**: A specialized reasoning component; attributes: name, capabilities list, version, allowed tools, guardrails.
- **Task**: A unit of work derived from an intent; attributes: id, session id, originating agent, status, created timestamp, completion timestamp, result summary.
- **Tool Invocation**: Execution record of an external action; attributes: id, task id, tool name, parameters (sanitized), outcome status, duration.
