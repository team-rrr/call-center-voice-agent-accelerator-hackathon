# Feature Specification: Voice-Enabled Multi-Agent Orchestration Accelerator

**Feature Branch**: `001-what-a-voice`
**Created**: 2025-09-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description (original): "A voice-enabled, multi-agent orchestration accelerator built with Azure AI, FastAPI, and Semantic Kernel." (NOTE: Implementation pivoted to Quart for the MVP; Semantic Kernel integration deferred. Description retained for historical context.) It lets users interact naturally via speech while intelligent agents handle tasks in the background. Why: To simplify the development of real-time, voice-first applications that require modular, intelligent behavior‚Äîmaking it easier for developers to prototype and deploy multi-agent systems without starting from scratch.

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input

   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
2. **Don't guess** missing details (scalability limits, retention, auth, etc.)
3. **Think like a tester**: every requirement must be verifiable
4. Common underspecified areas flagged below

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A product developer wants to quickly prototype a real-time voice interaction experience where an end user speaks naturally, the system transcribes speech, routes intent to one or more specialized intelligent agents (planner, domain expert, executor), and returns synthesized spoken and textual responses while background tasks continue until completion.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user starts a new voice session, **When** they speak an initial request (e.g., "Check order status and notify shipping"), **Then** the system should capture audio, produce a transcript, delegate sub-tasks to appropriate agents, and provide an audible confirmation.
2. **Given** an agent is executing a long-running background task, **When** the user asks for progress, **Then** the system reports current task status (queued, running, completed, failed) in both textual and spoken form.
3. **Given** simultaneous user speech overlap (user interrupts agent response), **When** interruption occurs, **Then** the system should stop playback and prioritize new user intent processing.
4. **Given** a restricted tool capability request (e.g., data export) outside user permissions, **When** the user attempts it, **Then** the system declines with a clear explanation and does not invoke the restricted action.

### Edge Cases
1. Network dropout mid-session: up to 3 reconnect retries over 15s; failure ‚Üí terminate with reason "connection_lost".
2. Extended silence: prompt at 30s; auto-terminate at 2m inactivity.
3. Rapid-fire commands: FIFO intent queue max depth 5; overflow yields polite overload notice.
4. Conflicting agent outputs: higher confidence wins; delta <0.1 ‚Üí ask user to clarify.
5. Background task failure while user idle: surfaced at next utterance or session summary.
6. Audio degradation: if avg transcription confidence <0.70 over last 3 utterances ‚Üí offer text-only mode.
7. (Removed) Consent revocation handling omitted for simplified scope.

### Functional Requirements

Audit Note: Original broader draft included requirements now intentionally deferred (multi-role access control, planner decomposition, advanced arbitration, transparency notice, max session duration control, background task lifecycle, fallback mode, injection prevention hardening). After scope reduction to a lean voice MVP, identifiers are renumbered contiguously. Content below reflects only retained MVP functionality.

**FR-001** System MUST allow a user to initiate a voice session via inbound PSTN call to a published ACS phone number.
**FR-002** System MUST auto-answer an inbound call within 3 rings and begin media streaming.
**FR-003** System SHOULD establish full-duplex audio between caller and AI within ~2 seconds of answer (best-effort; no formal latency instrumentation in MVP).
**FR-004** System MUST transcribe caller audio in near real-time and provide incremental partial hypotheses to the agent logic.
**FR-005** System MUST segment speech into finalized utterances using voice activity detection.
**FR-006** System MUST synthesize agent textual responses to audio (TTS) and stream them back with low perceived latency.
**FR-007** System MUST handle caller interruption (barge-in) by pausing or attenuating active AI playback and prioritizing new user speech.
**FR-008** System MUST maintain a rolling in-memory session context (recent N utterances + agent turns) for grounding.
**FR-009** System MUST end the session cleanly when caller hangs up or an agent issues an end directive.
**FR-010** System MUST build and retain (in memory only) a finalized transcript with speaker labels and timestamps for post-call inspection.
**FR-011** System MUST emit minimal internal events: session_started, utterance_started, utterance_finalized, agent_response, session_ended, error.
**FR-012** System MUST allow configuring the TTS voice via environment variable.
**FR-013** System MUST redact sequences of 12 or more consecutive digits in the final transcript view (simple regex best-effort) to reduce accidental leakage of obvious sensitive numbers.
**FR-014** System MUST expose a lightweight health endpoint returning build/version and readiness status.
**FR-015** System MUST support a pluggable agent strategy interface (e.g., echo vs. LLM) without changing the call handling pipeline.
**FR-016** System MUST retry transient outbound API calls (LLM / TTS) up to 2 additional times with backoff on network/server errors.
**FR-017** System MUST log structured error events including a stable error code and message (stack trace optional) for debugging.
**FR-018** System MUST cap in-memory context (by turn count or token estimate) and truncate oldest turns once the limit is exceeded.
**FR-019** System MUST mask raw audio payloads and API secrets (keys, tokens) from logs.
**FR-020** System MUST provide a simple in-browser developer test harness page to simulate or monitor a call session.
**FR-021** System MUST load configuration from environment variables with validation of required settings at startup and sane defaults for optional ones.
**FR-022** System SHOULD support hot reload / fast local dev workflow documented in the quickstart.
**FR-023** System MUST allow a placeholder function/tool invocation request from the agent runtime that is logged (no external side effects executed in MVP).

## Assumptions & Decisions
1. Silence prompt at 30s and termination at 2m (if implemented) are deferred; MVP only includes transcript redaction and basic end-session triggers (hangup or agent directive).
2. Confidence threshold (default 0.75) is configurable but no dynamic adaptation logic in MVP.
3. Multi-role access control, advanced arbitration heuristics, and session hard caps are deferred to a future iteration‚Äîremoved from current scope to minimize cognitive surface.
4. Queue depth management and background task lifecycle visibility are out-of-scope for MVP; any internal tasking will be minimal and not user-facing beyond placeholder tool invocation.
5. Latency targets are aspirational only; no instrumentation or SLO enforcement included.
6. Model versioning appears only as a passive string field; no migration handling required in MVP.

### Key Entities *(current MVP scope)*
- **Session**: Continuous interaction period; fields (MVP): id, status (active|ended), start_time, end_time (nullable), version. (Removed: language, metrics, user_role.)
- **Utterance**: Segment of caller speech; fields: id, session_id, text, confidence, start_time, end_time, interrupted.
- **Agent**: Pluggable strategy abstraction; fields: name, version, purpose (descriptive), allowed_tools (placeholder), guardrails (optional config object). Not all fields used in MVP runtime logic yet.
- **Task**: Deferred / minimal; retained schema for forward compatibility but not actively surfaced (status changes optional). Fields retained for future expansion.
- **Tool Invocation**: Placeholder record for logged function/tool calls; only id, task_id, tool_name, parameters (sanitized), outcome_status, duration, timestamp.
